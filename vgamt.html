title: Tackling Ambiguity with Images: Improved Multimodal Machine Translation and Contrastive Evaluation
---

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<br> <div style="text-align: justify"> One of the major challenges of machine translation (MT) is ambiguity, which can in some cases be resolved by 
  accompanying context such as images. However, recent work in mul005 timodal MT (MMT) has shown that obtaining improvements from images is challenging, 
  limited not only by the difficulty of building ef008 fective cross-modal representations, but also by the lack of specific evaluation and training data.
  We present a new MMT approach based on a strong text-only MT model, which uses neural adapters, a novel guided self-attention mechanism and which is 
  jointly trained on both visually-conditioned masking and MMT. We also introduce CoMMuTE, a Contrastive Multilingual Multimodal Translation Evaluation 
  set of ambiguous sentences and their possible translations, accompanied by disambiguating images corresponding to each translation. Our approach obtains
  competitive results compared to strong text-only models on standard English&#8594;French, English&#8594;German and English&#8594;Czech benchmarks 
  and outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art MMT systems by a large margin on our contrastive test set.</div> <br><br>
